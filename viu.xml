    <desc>說起設計，大眾的印象不外乎都是那幾樣：女生們的童年夢想——時裝設計師？抑或是男生們的「另一半」——汽車設計師。然而更多的，可能是來自父母的反對：不穩定？不實際？在我們創作力最旺盛的時候，這團烈火往往輕易就被澆熄。事實上，我們生活的每一處都充斥著設計的身影。你每天早上苦惱的髮型，你途中走過的建築，甚至是路過的一草一木，背後都是設計師精心設計過後呈現的藝術品。設計，絕非遙不可及。本節目將搜尋並拜訪香港本土各行設計師，了解這個行業的日常工作，發掘這方面的就業前景，讓對設計有興趣的年輕人知道更多這個行業的事，了解設計到底是怎麼一回事，在欣賞各種設計的同時，也希望呈現和宣揚本地設計師的創意，堅定每一位有設計夢的觀眾，讓創作的心燃燒下去。</desc>
